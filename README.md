# Online-Bus-Booking-System
Our Online Bus Booking System is a Java Spring Boot, MySQL and Angular project that runs on tomcat server.
The purpose of this project is to automate the Bus Booking System process.
Hence, we have designed a web-based application which is hosted on AWS that allows passengers to check ticket availability, book a bus ticket, and pay for it online.
